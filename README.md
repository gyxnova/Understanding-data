# Understanding-data
Understanding Data (EDA) – Practice notebook for exploring datasets, summarizing information, and finding patterns using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# 🔎 Understanding Data (Exploratory Data Analysis)

This repository contains my practice notebook for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – the process of understanding datasets, summarizing information, and finding insights before building machine learning models.

## 📖 Topics Covered
- Importing datasets (CSV, Excel)
- Viewing and summarizing data:
  - `head()`, `tail()`, `info()`, `describe()`
  - Checking data types
  - Finding missing values
- Statistical summaries (mean, median, mode)
- Data visualization for understanding:
  - Histograms & Boxplots for distribution
  - Scatter plots for relationships
  - Heatmaps for correlations
- Detecting outliers and patterns
- Preparing insights for next steps (cleaning, modeling)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🎯 Goal
To practice **data exploration techniques** and build strong EDA skills, making data ready for further analysis and machine learning projects.
